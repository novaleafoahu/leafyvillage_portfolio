## Introduction 
Crop rotation is important for a number of reasons.

1. Minimizes the accumulation of certain pests/insects. 
2. Allows for certain nutrient cycling and healthy bacteria to re-balance/re-store.  
3. Minimizes the spread of plant diseases
4. many more...

With that being said, Cornell [^1] recommends a 2 year period before replanting the same family in the same location. See  picture below where each crop represents a different family from the table below. Every year, each family is moved to a another location such that, crop 1 is planted in the same location after being "away" for two years.

Date is 2/20/24 in Zone 7b. Outdoors temps range hi 46, low 26. Over the weekend started seed prep in new winstrip trays by neversink farms. Initial impression....üëçvery nice.

Seeded (3) 128 count and (1) 50 count tray. Not sure how long it took.... about an hour?

One thing I found surprising are the empty spaces. Looks like it would be time wasted having to clear every hole. In actuality, soil falls right through with a few taps or a quick finger poke.

Trays include:

  - bunch of Napa cabbage
  - 64 carrots, 64 beets
  - iceberg and muir lettuce, and a few romaine

First time targeting harvest prior to summer since the lettuce/cabbage love bolting in heat. 


Plan on starting the summer veggies in Mid-March

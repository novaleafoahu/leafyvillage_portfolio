Pics are from 4/10/24 in Zone 7b. Todays temps are in the 70s. 

Learn a few things these weeks.

Purple leaves on young tomato plants are a non-issue. Used 4-5 grams of 20-20-20 general peters fertilizer mixed into 1 gallon of water. After a few days, the tomato plants recovered and most of all leaves returned to green!

Lettuce only need 30-45 days in a 128 cell tray. Any longer they will bunch up. The same with carrots.

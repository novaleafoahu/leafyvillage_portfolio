They make wonderful side dishes to go with meats, simple addition to salads, and make good for juicing. Cucumber plants may yield 20-25 lbs per plant annually. The cucumber types I have grown successfully are called Unagi, marketmore, and Gershin. Unagi is a long style cucumber with thin skin, the kind similar at BJs/Costco/Sams but taste much better when home grown. Marketmore is a thicker cucumber with thicker skin allowing for longer storage. The Gershin cucumber is a pickling cucumber, short, and stocky. Makes for excellent pickles for sandwiches and burgers.\nCucumbers can range in length from 3 inches to over 13 inches, vary by sweetness/bitterness, and harvesting .\nThis guide will provide an overview of how to grow cucumbers.\nStarting 🏁 First step, determine your Zone. Click here to access the zone map 🗺 or click the link on the left to access zone information. The dates below are mere guidelines as to the best time of year to start cucumber seeds. If seeds are started indoors too early, may outgrow the space and lighting available to continue growth in larger containers. If started too late, may not have enough time to obtain successful yields due to weather cooling or the young plants may not manage well under the hot summer sun.\nGuidelines for start dates gantt\rtitle Indoor start and transplant dates for cucumbers\raxisFormat %b-%e\rsection Zone 3a\rStart indoors :a1, 2014-05-09, 20d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-05-30, 30d\rsection Zone 3b - 4\rStart indoors :a1, 2014-05-09, 20d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-05-30, 30d\rsection Zone 5 and 6\rStart indoors :a1, 2014-04-09, 20d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-04-30, 30d\rsection Zone 7\rStart indoors :a1, 2014-04-09, 20d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-04-30, 30d\rsection Zone 8 Start indoors :a1, 2014-04-09, 21d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-04-30, 30d\rsection Zone 9 Start indoors :a1, 2014-02-07, 21d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-03-01, 30d\rsection Zone 10a Start indoors :a1, 2014-01-21, 21d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-02-14, 30d\rsection Zone 10b Start indoors :a1, 2014-01-21, 21d\rTransplant outdoors :crit, active, 2014-02-14, 30d Sizing Cucumber seeds should be started in 32 or 50 count trays.

They will out grow the space quickly which would requiring transferring the young seedlings to larger size pots. More handling of the young fragile seedlings = greater risk of damage, resulting in slow wilt, then eventual trip to the compost bin.\nSoil and seeding Utilize potting soil that can be purchased from major retailers like lowes/home depot/walmart/aldis/target. The bagged soil should be labeled potting soil. Potting soil is most suitable for seed germination due to its drainage capacity. Bags labeled garden soil or dirt will not allow good drainage in containers. Water drainage in containers are required to prevent water stagnation.
